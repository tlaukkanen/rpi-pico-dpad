# Raspberry Pi Pico game controller

This is a simple Micropython script for setting up your Raspberry Pi Pico to act as game controller. This setup uses six buttons and d-pad control.

You can use for example the following wiring. Please do note that the wiring in this schematics doesn't necessarily match the GPIO pins that are in the [main.py](main.py) script.

I created this to be used with my Gamedore 2064 gaming handheld device. You can read more information about that from my blog:
